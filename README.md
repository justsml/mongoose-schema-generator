This project ([Schema **Generator**](https://github.com/justsml/schema-generator)) is a web app with usage example for it's sister library [Schema **Analyzer**](https://github.com/justsml/schema-analyzer). The _Analyzer_ library provides an automatic data type analysis on any given array of objects.


The components included here support **JSON/CSV data!**


### Currently Supports...

- [x] Mongoose Schema definition - https://mongoosejs.com/
- [x] Knex Migration scripts - https://knexjs.org
- [ ] SQL DDL script (Data-definition language) - **Coming soon**
- [ ] TypeScript Types
- [ ] Validation Code for Libraries like `Yup` or `Joi`
- [ ] JSON Schemas (for libraries like `ajv`)
- [ ] Outputs for other languages/tools!

### Features

The primary goal is to support any input JSON/CSV and infer as much as possible. More data will generally yield better results.

- [x] Automatic type detection!
- [x] Detects String & Number size constraints (for SQL backends)!
- [x] Handles error/outliers intelligently
- [x] Ignores error/outlier records!
