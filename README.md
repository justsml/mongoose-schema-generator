[Schema **Generator**](https://github.com/justsml/schema-generator) is a web app which relies on it's sister library [Schema **Analyzer**](https://github.com/justsml/schema-analyzer) to provide an automatic code+interface generator - **based purely on provided JSON/CSV data.**


### Currently Supports...
